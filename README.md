# Completely Unfair Scheduler
In this project, we will learn how to create a custom scheduler for the Linux kernel. We will begin by learning how the Linux scheduler has progressed over time and some considerations we must make while designing a time-sharing general purpose scheduler.

## Round Robin Scheduling
This is the most naive scheduler, but also the one we will be writing in this project.
